# Protagonist Can Die Mod for EET
k4thos's Protagonist Can Die AKA Player 1 Can Die mod for EE games &amp; EET.  [Gibberlings3 Forum Link](http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=28910)

Remember, with this mod installed, the game assumes the protagonist is alive (and not petrified nor affected by _imprisonment_) during cutscenes, certain dialog, and in general!  This mod is most useful to help ensure only a total party kill will cause a game over in most fights!
